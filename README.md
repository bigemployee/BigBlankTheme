What is Big Blank Theme?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
[Big Blank Theme] is a blank responsive theme for WordPress, with semantic HTML5 
code and a very minimal CSS styling. This is not a naked or barebone theme, 
but a clean starting boilerplate for a more complex theme development. It makes 
development of complex themes easier. Sometimes you don't want to start your 
theme development from scratch. This is where this minimalistic blank and 
responsive WordPress theme comes in. Most of the necessary styles that don't 
matter much are provided, such as comments, forms, and regular styling of 
common elements such as headings, image alignments, etc... However, the rest of 
the layout has a very minimal styling, so you could start developing your own 
theme.
